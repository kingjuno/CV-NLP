    "# Use a pre-trained network with transfer learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Training CNN's can take a lot of time, and a lot of data is required for that task. However, much of the time is spent to learn the best low-level filters that a network is using to extract patterns from images.\n",
    "The approach of using a neural network trained on one dataset and adapt it to classifying different images without fulltraining is called **transfer learning**. In transfer learning, we typically start with a pre-trained model, which has been trained on some large image dataset, such as ImageNet. Those models can already do a good job extracting different features from generic images, and in many cases just building a classifier on top of those extracted features can yield a good result."
